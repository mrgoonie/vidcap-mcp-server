# Research Task: SSH Directory Command Timeout Analysis

## Research Assignment

**Task**: Analyze the timeout mechanism in the SSH directory change command implementation

**Focus Areas**:
1. **Current timeout logic analysis** - Examine the Timer.periodic monitoring loop in `_executeDirectoryChangeCommand`
2. **Completion detection mechanism** - Analyze how the cd+pwd flow completion is detected
3. **Stream processing timing** - Investigate potential race conditions between output parsing and timeout
4. **Buffer management** - Review how the StringBuffer accumulates output and when it's processed
5. **Phase tracking logic** - Examine the cdPhaseComplete and pwdPhaseComplete boolean flags

**Key Files to Analyze**:
- `/Users/duynguyen/www/devpocket-mvp-app/lib/core/services/ssh_service.dart` (lines 601-773)
- `/Users/duynguyen/www/devpocket-mvp-app/logs.txt` (focusing on lines 67-71)

**Log Evidence**:
- Line 67: `DIR_CHANGE_SUCCESS_1758278735459` - CD command succeeded
- Line 69: "CD command successful, executing pwd to get current directory"
- Line 70: Shows pwd output `/home` - pwd command also successful
- Line 71: "Error executing directory change command: Directory change command timed out"

**Research Questions**:
1. Why does the 8-second timeout trigger when both cd and pwd commands complete successfully?
2. Is there a race condition between the Timer.periodic loop and the timeout Timer?
3. Are the completion conditions properly detecting the pwd phase completion?
4. Is the StringBuffer processing happening fast enough to set pwdPhaseComplete = true?

**Expected Output**:
Detailed analysis report in `./plans/reports/001-from-researcher-timeout-analysis-to-planner-report.md`

**Success Criteria**:
- Identify the root cause of the false timeout
- Propose specific technical solutions to fix the completion detection
- Recommend timeout value adjustments if needed
- Identify any race conditions or timing issues
