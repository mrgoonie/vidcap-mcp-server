# Research Task: Timer and Concurrency Issues Analysis

## Research Assignment

**Task**: Investigate potential concurrency issues between the timeout timer and completion detection

**Focus Areas**:
1. **Timer concurrency** - Analyze interaction between `Timer(8 seconds)` and `Timer.periodic(100ms)`
2. **Completer race conditions** - Examine if completer.complete() can be called multiple times
3. **Stream subscription management** - Review cleanup() method and stream cancellation timing
4. **Resource cleanup** - Investigate if early cleanup affects completion detection
5. **Error propagation** - Analyze how exceptions are handled in the async flow

**Key Files to Analyze**:
- `/Users/duynguyen/www/devpocket-mvp-app/lib/core/services/ssh_service.dart` (lines 618-643, 668-736)
- Focus on Timer management and Completer usage patterns

**Log Evidence**:
- Commands execute successfully but timeout still triggers
- Both cd and pwd complete within the 8-second window
- Timer.periodic should detect completion but timeout Timer fires instead

**Research Questions**:
1. Is there a race condition between Timer.periodic completion detection and timeout Timer?
2. Can the cleanup() method be called before completion detection finishes?
3. Is the Completer properly guarded against multiple completions?
4. Should the timeout be longer or the periodic check frequency adjusted?
5. Are there any blocking operations preventing timely completion detection?

**Expected Output**:
Detailed analysis report in `./plans/reports/003-from-researcher-concurrency-analysis-to-planner-report.md`

**Success Criteria**:
- Identify specific race conditions or timing issues
- Analyze Timer management patterns for potential improvements
- Propose specific concurrency fixes
- Recommend optimal timing values for reliable operation
